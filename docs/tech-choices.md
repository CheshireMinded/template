- Rich plugin ecosystem  

---

## DevOps / Platform Tools

### Docker
- Standard container packaging  
- Reproducible environments  

### Kubernetes + Helm
- Industry-standard deployment orchestration  
- Declarative infrastructure  
- Demonstrates real production architecture  

### Terraform
- Infrastructure-as-Code for cloud providers  
- Best practice for reproducible environments  

---

## CI/CD - GitHub Actions

- Built-in  
- Secure, isolated runners  
- Easy to version  
- Integrates well with code scanning, SBOM, linting, and tests  

---

## Security Tools
