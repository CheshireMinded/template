# SECURITY.md - Template Repository Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT NOTICE - THIS IS A TEMPLATE REPOSITORY**  
This repository is a *non-production template* provided for demonstration, learning, and project bootstrapping purposes.  
It is **not an actively maintained software product**, and **no real security monitoring is performed**.

**Do NOT report real-world vulnerabilities, sensitive findings, or exploits to this repository.**  
There is **no operational security team** associated with this template.

---

## Purpose of This File

`SECURITY.md` is included **only as an example** of how you might structure a security policy for a real application built *from* this template.

If you clone or fork this template to build an actual product, you **must replace this file** with:

- Your organization's supported version list  
- Real reporting channels  
- Disclosure timelines  
- Incident response procedures  
- Security ownership (teams, emails, escalation paths)  

The policies included here **are not active** and **do not represent real commitments or contacts**.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Template Notice)

Because this is a template:

- **Do not open security issues**  
- **Do not email confidentiality-sensitive findings**  
- **Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly or privately**  

There is **no valid security contact** for this repository.

If you use this template in your own organization, you must provide:

- A monitored security inbox  
- An internal or external disclosure process  
- Verification and remediation SLAs  
- Disclosure guidelines for third-party researchers  

---

## Example Only: What a Real Policy Might Contain

In a production environment, your own `SECURITY.md` might describe:

- **Supported Environments**  
  Which branches, releases, or services receive fixes.

- **Responsible Disclosure Guidelines**  
  How researchers should report vulnerabilities securely.

- **Response Timelines**  
  Example:  
  - Acknowledge report: 48-72 hours  
  - Evaluate + assign severity: 5 business days  
  - Provide remediation plan: 10-15 days  

- **Security Controls**  
  Such as:  
  - Mandatory HTTPS  
  - Security headers  
  - Secret management policies  
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning  
  - IaC and CI/CD hardening  

These items exist in `docs/security/` as examples and learning material only.

---

## Included Security Resources (Demonstration Only)

This template includes *non-binding example documentation*, including:

- Threat model (`THREAT_MODEL.md`)
- Security headers (`docs/security/security-headers.md`)
- Pentest templates  
- Red-team simulation plan  
- Bug bounty template  
- Secure SDLC checklist  
- SOC 2 starter controls  
- Terraform hardening examples  

These are **educational**, not enforced or monitored.

---

## Final Note

This template repository:

- Should NOT receive real vulnerability disclosures  
- Should NOT be used as an authoritative security reference  
- **Should be customized** before any real deployment  
- Can serve as a strong starting point for building your own security program documentation  

If you fork this template to build a real system, **replace this file immediately** with your actual security policy.
